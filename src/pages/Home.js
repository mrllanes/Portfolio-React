                            These are all characteristics that Michael Llanes
                            believes are necessary for a successful career.
                            Respect for those above you and respect for those
                            below you. No one is better than you and no one
                            deserves to be treated poorly. You may be their boss
                            today and in five years, they may be offering you a
                            job. Always show respect to everyone. Loyalty to
                            your company, your teammates and your clients.
                            Leaving a company for a few bucks more a day is not
                            always a good thing. They will remember, especially
                            when you realize you made a mistake and try to come
                            back. Stick up for your teammates and they will have
                            your back. Your clients will remember the things you
                            did for them and will keep you around because you do
                            good work for them and recommend them to others.
                            Always carry yourself in a dignified, professional
                            manner. You represent yourself and your company at
                            all times. Work and behave in a way that others will
                            believe you to be reliable, competent, mature and
                            respectful. Work can be tough and things do not
                            always go your way, be persistent with your
                            solutions. Be determined to find answers, to improve
                            yourself and not leave others disappointed in your
                            efforts. Be commited to all that you do. Not
                            everyone knows what you know, and you do not know
                            everything that others know. Show patience to
                            others, this above other things will be most
                            appreciated by those needing your help.

                        <p>
                            These characteristics should be seen in you as much
                            as in those surrounding you. When you see that, you
                            know you are in the right place.

                        <h1>An Introduction to Your Key Asset</h1>
                        <p>
                            Michael Llanes graduated from Our Lady of the Lake
                            University with a Bachelor of Arts. He started his
                            career in the technology industry, well before
                            graduating from college, as computers were
                            fascinating and improving at an alarming rate.
                            Michael learned all aspects of computer hardware and
                            worked at several companies as desktop support, team
                            trainer, asset manager, business analyst, systems
                            support and network engineer. Starting at level one
                            support and rising to team supervisor, IT manager
                            and even Director of Information Technology over the
                            course of several years.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the year 2000, Michael decided to take his knack
                            for training others, and his love of technology, and
                            decided to get a teaching certifcate to teach high
                            school students. This is also the time that Michael
                            earned his CCNA certification. With these, he taught
                            the CCNA curriculem at the Cisco Networking Acedemy
                            located on the Wunsche Career Campus in Spring ISD.
                            As he was taking the CCNA courses himself, he caught
                            the eye of the instructors and was asked to also
                            teach at the Cisco Networking Academy located at the
                            Tomball College campus (now known as Lone Star
                            College-Tomball). As the Tomball academy was
                            considered the Regional Academy, it is the only
                            place where instructors teach other people how to be
                            instructors. Michael taught the Cisco CCNA
                            classNamees to both high school students (during the
                            day) and college student (at night) for several
                            years before transitioning into the energy sector.

                            Although teaching was extremely enjoyable, in 2005
                            Michael became a landman. A landman, as defined by
                            the AAPL: "A landman is the public facing side of an
                            oil, gas and mineral exploration and production
                            team. A professional landman interacts and
                            negotiates directly with landowners to acquire oil
                            and gas drilling leases on behalf of oil and gas
                            companies." If you are unfamiliar with a landman,

                            Michael's technological knowledge and his knack for
                            training/teaching others has been a great asset in
                            this industry. He has worked independantly, as part
                            of a team, training new landmen, as assistant crew
                            chief and team lead. Early on, Michael and his wife
                            created Senall Sabres, LLC., and have been working
                            through their company for several clients throughout
                            the years. Working both in the field and in-house,
                            Michael has made several contacts in the industry
                            and has been very fortunate to continue working
                            through all the downturns during his time in oil and
                            gas.
